## Dimensions

Refer to `dimensions.png` or `dimensions-overlay.png` for buttons and spacing. It is common to all designs.

## Bounding box

Of course when building an ASC, the bounding box can be the size of your choice, but if you wanna go with the arcade size here is some additional information.

### Type A

Type A control panel has no bounding box around the printed design.

### Type B

SD cab type B has :
- two colored sides which are `25mm` thick each
- a white center part which is `748mm` thick
- a small `1mm` gap between each side and the center part (to account for panel hinge mechanism)

Panel depth (from top view) :
- bottom margin is `35mm`
- printed trapezoid acrylic panel height is `280mm`
- top margin is `25mm`

**In conclusion :**

- cabinet total width is `25+1+748+1+25 = 800mm` (colored side + gap + center part + gap + colored side).
- panel total depth, from player to cab monitor is `35+280+25 = 340mm` (top view: bottom margin + design + top margin).
- the front part of the panel has a fillet (edge is rounded). The fillet edge has a radius of about `30mm`.


## Donation

If this project helps you and you want to give back, you can help me with my future projects.

While not necessary, donations are much appreciated and will only go towards funding future github projects (arcade hardware ain't cheap :( ).

Of course you'll also receive my gratitude and I'll remember you if you post a feature request ;)
