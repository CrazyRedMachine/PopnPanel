# PopnPanel - DIY CONTROLLERS

Here you'll find dxf and artwork to make your own controllers with these designs.

There is a fullsize (100mm) and a mini (60mm) version.

## Preview

### Fullsize (using 100mm buttons)

### Minicon (using 60mm buttons)

## How to build

### Material needed

 - **6mm thick** wood for the structure
 - **3mm thick** acrylic for the top cover
 - 9x 60/100mm dome buttons (depending on the build you're going for)
 - 2x 30mm buttons (for test/service side buttons)

### The outside

You need access to a laser cutter (for the .dxf files) and a big printer (for the .png).

If you wish to make some changes or generate higher quality renders, the artwork svg is included as well

(there are many online services all around the world which can laser cut or print for you if you send them the files)

Once you receive the cut material, you can assemble everything but the bottom plate with wood glue, then place paper print on top and finally the acrylic.

Button nuts will hold the print and acrylic in position.

I recommend using door magnets to make the bottom plate easily removable.

### The inside

I recommend getting an Arduino Leonardo and following instructions from [UltimatePopnController](https://github.com/CrazyRedMachine/UltimatePopnController)

## Donation

If this project helps you and you want to give back, you can help me with my future projects.

While not necessary, donations are much appreciated and will only go towards funding future github projects (arcade hardware ain't cheap :( ).

Of course you'll also receive my gratitude and I'll remember you if you post a feature request ;)
